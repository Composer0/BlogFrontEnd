# Blog

Creating a blog for my portfolio and to document my journey as an early career web developer.

## Day 1

Focused on creating the frontend look of the blog. Completed Navbar, Header, and Sidebar.
Learned about how to use flex values ... ex. Flex: 3;... This concept reminds me of using columns in Bootstrap. I'm sure this will make things easier when I begin to develop media queries towards the end of this project.

## Day 2
Provided more flavor to the to the site to bring the feel of it more in line with what my portfolio looks like. Trying to establish a sense of branding.
Created post and posts components. Focused on creating the presentation of posts and how they will be shown on the main page. Posts are currently placeholders.
Learned how to cut off text with line-clamp and use text-overflow to create ellipsis.

## Day 3
Added Write and Settings page components to the blog project.
Learned how to incorporate htmlFor to add documents from local drive. Need to learn how to incorporate this feature to make changes server side.
Also learned about autoFocus on page load. This is being implemented on the write page in the title bar.
