# Blog

Creating a blog for my portfolio and to document my journey as an early career web developer.

## Day 1

Focused on creating the frontend look of the blog. Completed Navbar, Header, and Sidebar.
Learned about how to use flex values ... ex. Flex: 3;... This concept reminds me of using columns in Bootstrap. I'm sure this will make things easier when I begin to develop media queries towards the end of this project.
